# TheZZAZZGlitch2022Event
These are all my notes on TheZZAZZGlitch's 2022 April Fools event. This includes a full walkthrough with a technical breakdown of the Cracker Cavern challenges. I would suggest starting there, though you might also be interested in the source code for the Emerald Script Disassembler, or my bruteforcer for Cracker Cavern 3.

If you're interested in the walkthrough/technical explanation, it's in the .odt format, so I suggest LibreOffice to open it. It'll probably look better if you change to webview.

For compiling the source code, I used GCC with the -Wall and -O3 flags.
